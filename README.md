# Bitcoin Price App

This is a simple Flutter application that fetches the current **Bitcoin price in BRL** (Brazilian Real) using the [Blockchain.info API](https://blockchain.info/ticker).

The app displays the current BTC price and allows the user to refresh it with a button click.

## First experience using API
